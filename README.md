This repository contains the on-going work related to the also on-going work
concerning the extension of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) to
Electrochemical (EC) systems. So far, the following publication exist:

- Beruski, O. Stochastic Electrochemical Kinetics. arxiv:1608.07507

The codes are mainly meant for the reproduction of the data provided in
the papers, but also for those who aren't versed in programming and feel
like using the method. Hopefully, the code are checked for bugs and, being
part of my own work, constantly updated and used.

Also, any feedback is extremely welcome.
